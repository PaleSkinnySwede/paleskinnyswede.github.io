Tucked away in a cabin in the Swedish mountains, I wrote this song on my laptop while the rest of the family was asleep. It's a bit dark and lacking melodies compared to what I usually do but it still has its place in my song catalogue.

The song is divided into two parts which are pretty similar. The second part has some [TB-303]() and [SH-101]() arpeggios going to give it more drive and energy.
