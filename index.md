Hey there — welcome! 👋

I'm PaleSkinnySwede, a music producer and remixer who enjoys sculpting sounds from samples, synths, and the occasional moment of solitude. This blog is my digital liner notes — a place where I share:

🎵 **Original Productions** — uptempo and uplifting edm as well as space-trance.

🔁 **Remixes** — I'm turning awesome pop songs into dull souless dance music.

🎙️ **Behind the Tracks** — insights into my creative process, tools I use, and techniques you might want to try yourself.

🧠 Whether you're into sound design, just curious about how songs come together, or here to discover new music — I'm glad you're here.
