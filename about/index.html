                PaleSkinnySwede is my take on EDM, Space Trance and Uplifting Trance, drawing tons of inspiration from artists like <i>Angle Ace</i>, <i>Christian Zechner</i>, <i>Jon O'Bir</i>, <i>Aly & Fila</i>, <i>7 Skies</i>, <i>Dan Stone</i>, <i>Stoneface & Terminal</i>, <i>John 00 Fleming</i> and my long-time house gods; <i>Trouser Enthusiasts</i>. Not everything is dull souless dance music.

                The name came about when I together with Fred Muskos were producing Swedish pop bands using <i>"Pale Skinny Swedes"</i> as a pseudonym. I took over the name and used it for my Electronic Dance Music to distinguish from my other musical journeys and adventures.
