                PaleSkinnySwede is my take on EDM, Space Trance and Uplifting Trance, drawing tons of inspiration from artists like Angle Ace, Christian Zechner, Jon O'Bir, Aly & Fila, 7 Skies, Dan Stone, Stoneface & Terminal and my long-time house gods; Trouser Enthusiasts. Not everything is a dull souless dance music.

                The name came about when I together with Fred Muskos were producing Swedish pop bands using "Pale Skinny Swedes" as a pseudonym. I took over the name and used it for my Electronic Dance Music to distinguish from my other musical journeys and adventures.
